# General Comments

The purpose of this tool is to enumerate users and run dictionary/brute force
attack against the login form while enumerating users. In addition, there is
functionality that will allow the script to grab a valid csrf token based on
either the time sequence delay that the csrf token is generated or per request.

This is still in the build phase, no generalization or automation has been
implemented.
